## Website Purpose

The heart and soul of the site, and the guides contained within, is to help blend the worlds of the **HDR Purist:** *who mainly uses ReShade as a tool to fix a game's HDR or to add HDR if the game doesn't natively support it*, and the **ReShader:** *who uses ReShade to fix, enhance, or otherwise
change a game's visuals to something that is more to their liking.*  


## Contributors

Website created and maintained by **Creepy (CreepySasquatch)**.
- All guides are written by Creepy as well. 

**Soop (smolbbsoop):**the creator of the HDR converter that is essential to getting non-HDR shaders working with native HDR and mods like RenoDX. 
- Soop's shaders can be found within the ReShade installer or at their Github page: <https://github.com/smolbbsoop/smolbbsoopshaders>

**Lazorr:** for helping update the guide site visuals to something more modern.
