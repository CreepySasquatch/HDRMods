## Installation Steps:

1. Download everything mentioned in the links above (RenoDX mod, ReShade, and Special K).

	1. While you technically don't need to select any shaders from the ReShade installation, we highly recommend grabbing Lilium's HDR Analysis tool.  This will come in handy when configuring the in-game HDR settings.  
		- <details><summary>This is listed under <b>ReShade HDR shaders by Lilium</b> and the shader is called <b>lilium_hdrand_sdr_analysis.fx</b>. You can click <b>Sort by:</b> and change the option to <b>A to Z</b> to make finding Lilium's shaders easier. (<i>Click to expand.</i>)</summary>
